If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses globally, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavors of the cheese. Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its color by adding a coloring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption. The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavored it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda, such as a five-year aged cheese, develops a strong flavor that cheese aficionados prefer to eat alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to their caramel and robust flavor. Gouda cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when paired with some white wines and fruity wines."

In the case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium. In the MidEast countries such as Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep’s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole milk of cow. The cheese is flavored with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name ‘Jibneh Mshallaleh’. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and liquorice flavored Greek liqueur, Ouzo.

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon also known as Banon à la feuille is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era. The cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheesemakers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavor to the cheese. Banon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and grey moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavor. The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavor with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from a firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavor. The local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar, and the cheese is left to ferment with just a sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes. Banon goes well with a crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine."

Bleu Des Causses	unpasteurized cow's milk	France	"Languedoc, Midi Pyrenees"	Blue	"semi-soft, blue-veined"	45%		natural	creamy	blue	"salty, spicy"	"grassy, strong"				no	"Bleu des Causses is a French blue cheese made from raw milk cow. A close cousin to Roquefort, it is produced in the Languedoc region of southern France and was granted AOC name protection. Traditionally, the cheese was made from a mixture of sheep's milk mixed either with cow's or goat's milk. But according to French cheese laws, the cheese came to be made exclusively from cow's milk. Bleu des Causses has a high-fat content of 45% and is matured for at least seventy days. However, the cheese can also be matured for up to six months in Causses plateau in natural limestone caves. The cheese is similar to Blue d'Auvergne in many ways, despite Bleu des Causses having a noticeably firmer, creamier texture and spicy flavors. Bleu des Causses produced in winter and summer slightly differ in texture and flavor. Cheeses made in winter are light in color than their summer equals. The winter produce also tends to be slightly drier. A taste of the Bleu des Causses will proffer a blend of rich milkiness amidst the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mould. The summer produce brings out its unique grassy and clover flavors. It pairs excellently with sweet white wine and dessert wines such as Sauternes or Mulderbosch Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc."

During ageing, the blue cheeses are kept in temperature-controlled environments such as caves. Australia has made historic progress in producing a variety of Blue Cheeses. The cheesemakers of Australia have been making blue-veined cheese for over 70 years. The first blue cheese factories were recorded to have started in northern New South Wales and Gippsland in the 1930s and 1940s.

The final product is characterized by green, grey, blue or black veins or spots of mould throughout the body. These veins are created during the production stage when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mould. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavor. The origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheesemaker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned back, he discovered that the mould covering the bread had transformed it into a blue cheese. Blue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavor of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and ageing period. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheese around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England. Blue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts. Crumble the cheese and melt it into sour cream, plain yoghurt or mayonnaise as a dressing."

Brie is a soft cheese named after the French region Brie, where it was originally created. Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings. In France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. Real French Brie is unstabilized and the flavor is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections. Brie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added to the raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37°C (99°F) to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks. Brie cheese is slightly pale in color with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavor varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese. Brie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature. Please note: Pasteurized milk is required in the United States and Australia."

The difference between production and maturation places is a typical Brie tradition. This is a soft, unpasteurised cow's milk cheese covered with a bloomy rind resulting from inoculation with Penicillium Candidum moulds. As the cheese ages, the rind develops red or brown patches.

Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odour from bacteria used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft, and the rind is slightly dry. The rind turns darker and crumbly as the cheese matures to a Brie Noir. In addition, the pate is drier and darker, and the flavor is stronger to taste. The usual flavors are strongly lactic and slightly salty, finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like croûte au brie.

Cheeses similar to Caciocavallo are common all over the Balkans and Southern Italy. In fact, Ragusano DOP from Sicily had to drop the name Caciocavallo Ragusano to achieve the DOP label. Continuous exposure to humidity in the caves and ageing develops sharp, spicy flavors in Caciocavallo. With persistent ageing, the cheese picks up intense, earthy undertones and fruity aromas. Along the way, it turns from a milky white to a darker yellow in color and becomes saltier. The result is a cheese with profound tasting notes and a perfect accompaniment to a glass of Primitivo red wine."

Its texture and flavor resemble cheddar, the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom.  The recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired by other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its rugged texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands, while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals. Caerphilly is made from unpasteurised cow's milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a more rigid texture and more robust taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy, and the flavor becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel shape with ivory-white rind dusted with refined flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and grey moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian, depending upon the brand. A basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It usually is grated or melted onto dishes."

Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavor and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavor, texture and aroma of cheddar cheese can vary. Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in color but due to the addition of tasteless food coloring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavor-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow’s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its ageing time. In Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize-winning cheddar maker in Canada is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavored cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavors, made in Canada includes cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.

Caravane	pasteurized camel's milk	Mauritania			"soft, artisan"	22%		bloomy	creamy	white	"salty, sweet"		Tiviski	Camelbert		yes	"Caravane is modern-day’s, first camel cheese produced in the early nineties by Nancy Abeiderrhamane. Its similarity to camembert has earned Caravane the nickname, ‘camelbert cheese’. Her dairy, Tiviski, located in the capital of West African Mauritania makes this cheese with the help of milk collected from the local camel herds. Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield. By using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine. Since the Mauritanians don’t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores. Caravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow’s, buffalo’s, sheep’s or goat’s cheese. In fact, it has 3 times more nutrients than cow’s milk."

Chèvre	pasteurized or unpasteurized goat's milk	France			"soft, semi-soft, hard, firm"				firm and soft	white	"earthy, tangy, tart"			Goat cheese			"Chevre is a French word for goat’s cheese, i.e. cheese made from goat’s milk. They are popular among the elderly and children, who are more likely to show low tolerance to cow’s milk. Also, goat cheeses are lower in fat and higher in vitamin A and potassium. They serve as a perfect substitute for many dieters. A majority of goat cheeses come from France, the most famous among them being Bucheron, Chabis and Crottin de Chavignol. Goat cheeses have a unique, tart, earthy flavor that sets them apart from cow milk cheeses. This distinctive tang and aroma of the cheese become stronger as it ages. Milk production of goats, unlike cows, is seasonal from mid-March through October. Only a few kinds of cheese are aged beyond four months, and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd. Goat cheeses come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shaped, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or drinks."

There are practically 83 flavors, which can be savoured while tasting Comté.

In fact, Feta occupies 70% stake in Greek cheese consumption. The cheese is protected by EU legislation and only those cheeses manufactured in Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Lesvos and Island of Kefalonia can be called ‘feta’. Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called ‘white cheese’. To create traditional feta, 30 percent of goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat and cow’s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavor differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavor. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, full flavored and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, cultures all have an impact on the texture, flavor and aroma of feta. On the whole, Feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age which can be extremely creamy, or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavor of Feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel."

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in two varieties. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk and Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavorful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses whole cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it is produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for less time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but is slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low in fat.Double Gloucester has a smooth buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavor and apricot color due to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used, and the cheese is aged for at least four months. The cheese develops more complex and nutty flavors if it is aged further. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky. Double Gloucester participates every year in Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah perfectly complements a Double Gloucester."

Around the world, Grana is a generic term used to define three main varieties of cheeses namely - Parmigianino Reggiano, Grana Padano and Grana Trentino and other smaller variants like Granone Lodigiano, Trentingrana and Gransardo. However, in Europe, the word 'Grana' is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin. Only Grana Padano can use the term to sell its produce in EU countries. The most popular Grana Italian cheeses are of course Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano. True Parmigianino Reggiano, named after the Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua, where it is produced, has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste. On the other hand, Grana Padano refers to the valley Pianura Padana where it is made. Though similar to Parmigianino Reggiano, young Grana Padano is slightly less crumbly, milder and less complex than its famous, aged kin. On the other hand, Grana Trentino follows the same method to produce Parmigianino Reggiano but is made in the province of Trento, giving it its name.

The cheese is made from unpasteurised, semi-skimmed cow’s milk from two milkings and generally aged for two years. At the end of the cheese-making process, Grana Padano develops a firm, thick and deeply straw-colored rind protecting the fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means “grainy” in Italian, which is reflected in the fine granular texture with an intensely sweet flavor. As Grana Padano ages, the flavors become pronounced, savoury and complex, and the texture becomes more crumbly. Though similar to Parmigiano, Reggiano Grana Padano is inexpensive cheese. Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling. Grana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter and 15 to 18 cm in height. It is sold at different ripening stages: Grana Padano (9 to 16 months), Grana Padano oltre 16 mesi (over 16 months) and Grana Padano Riserva (over 20 months).

Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavored variant of Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavors rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

It is a soft, wet cheese made from raw cow milk and can be ripened or unripened depending on its variation. The tradition of making Minas cheese is more than 300 years old. In May 2008, the original firm, ripened Minas cheese was declared a Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage. The time left to ripen Minas cheese can vary from as little as 4 -10 days, which results in queijos-de-minas frescal cheese. It has a spongy texture, with lots of air bubbles inside with a mild yet quite salty taste. The saltiness will vary according to the region and producer. This is not a good cooking cheese but can be used to make sandwiches, pastries and crêpes. The texture tends to become slightly rubbery rather than stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked strong-tasting vegetables and salads. If left to mature for around 1-5 weeks, the soft unripened variety develops into partly-cured Minas cheese (queijo minas meia-cura). The fully-cured variety of Minas cheese called queijo minas curado is ready when juicy softness has evaporated and it acquires a yellowish tint. Curado cheese has a white core, pricked with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a more stronger taste, deviating to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used in a huge variety of dishes, particularly the famous pão de queijo (cheese bun). One of the most popular desserts in Brazil is a sweet dish called goiabada prepared with Minas cheese and guavas. A branded, supermarket variety called Queijo Padrao is also popular across Brazil. It is similar to frescal, except that it is less soft, juicy and salty than the original."

The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and ‘spun’ in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry.  In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union."

Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia) and Pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany) are not that salty.  As the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella, have mentioned cheese & its production techniques. Even today, cheese is made using the traditional method. The wheels get salted numerous times by hand to deliver a fabulous taste. After ageing for more than five months,  it develops a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with a sweet and aromatic flavor. The flavor becomes sharper and smokier when aged for more than eight months.  Pecorino Romano is one of the most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheese. Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, bread and baking casseroles.

Though many countries have started producing this cheese, traditional Provolone is still produced only in the northern region of Italy.

Provolone ValPadana, a DOP protected cheese variant, is made from the whole milk of cows grazing in the plains from Milan to Udine. Animal rennet is used to produce Provolone ValPadana, which is then moulded into various traditional shapes and matured depending on the weight of the cheese. The cheese has a sweet, delicate flavor that becomes spicier and more pronounced throughout curing. There are two types of Provolone available. Provolone Dolce is aged 2-3 months and has a pale yellow to white color with a sweet taste. The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. Either version may be smoked, specified as 'Affumicata'. Provolone Dolce goes well with young and fruity wines such as Novello, Barbera and Valcalepio. Provolone Piccante makes a good pairing with aged and structured wines, like Amarone, Valpolicella, Refosco, and Barbaresco.

After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to 'remilk' (reblocher) the cows. The second milking of cows yielded milk that was rich in fat, and was used to make Reblochon. Reblochon features a fine, velvety rind, varying from yellow to orange. The close textured pate is very smooth, supple and ivory in color. Farmhouse cheese discs are matured for at least two weeks, during which the cheese develops an edible light beige crust and buttery dough. Reblochon has a slight scent of the cellar and a mild fruity taste with an intense nutty aftertaste. Its delicate and subtle flavors go well with a glass of Savoie wine.

Red Leicester	unpasteurized cow's milk	United Kingdom	Leicestershire	Cheddar	"hard, artisan"	48%		cloth wrapped	crumbly and dense	orange	"burnt caramel, full-flavored, sweet"	rich	Leicestershire Handmade Cheese Company	"Leicestershire, Leicester"		no	"Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow’s milk. The history of cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the color of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is colored with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The color indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk. Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavor. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavor, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavor and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray."

Most truffle cheeses have shavings of truffles in them, but sometimes they can be flavored with truffle oil. Italy and France are popular for their variety of truffle cheeses. Here is a look at some of the truffle cheeses:  Truffle Tremor – Made by Cypress Grove, California, is a goat’s milk cheese with fragments of truffle right through the soft, creamy cheese.   Sottocenere – A semi-soft Italian cheese with flavors of liquorice, nutmeg, coriander, cloves, cinnamon and fennel coated onto the rind. Moliterno Black Truffle Pecorino – A raw sheep’s milk Sardinian cheese covered with black truffle paste. It tastes nutty, earthy and salty, similar to a pecorino. The distinctive layers of truffles can be seen throughout the cheese. Boschetto al Tartufo - A semi-soft Italian cheese made with a blend of cow and sheep’s milk. Mild cheese is dictated by the flavors of white truffles.   Truffle and Salt Cheddar – From the Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese in Idaho, this is an aged, pasteurised cheddar flavored with black truffle salt. Truffle Gouda – Dutch Gouda sprinkled with black truffle. It tastes less sharp and sweet than other types of Gouda.  These cheeses taste delicious with condiments, for example, Truffle and Porto Sauce, Black Truffle Mustard, Black Truffle Sherry Vinegar and many others."

As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.

The interior of the cheese is straw colored with an open and buttery texture. Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find.

It was a deliberate attempt to develop a meaty flavor in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for a long period. Washed rind cheeses are periodically washed in a solution of saltwater brine, wines and/or mould-bearing agents so that their surface becomes responsive to bacteria. This bacterium (Brevibacterium Linens) “smears” the cheese with a firm, palatable, bright red/orange rind and imparts pungent odours and distinctive flavors to the product. Also known as surface-ripened, the cheeses can be soft, semi-hard, or hard. Some common examples are Titlist, Gruyere and Raclette, and their rinds are washed during the maturation process to develop a crusty shell. These rich cheeses have a robust aroma with a sweet, earthy and little nutty flavor."
